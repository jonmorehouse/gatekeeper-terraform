# Gatekeeper Terraform

[gatekeeper](https://github.com/jonmorehouse/gatekeeper) is an http routing runtime.

This `terraform` module provides a way to spin up an isolated `gatekeeper` cluster for accepting public traffic and routing it to your infrastructure. By configuring different upstream and routing plugins almost any cloud setup is supportable.

This module can spin up a multi-az AWS or multi zone GCE gatekeeper cluster.
